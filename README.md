# Sustainable, Green Blockchain Infrastructure

## Project Title
Sustainable, “Green” Blockchain Infrastructure

## Project Description
A Solidity-based blockchain project designed to make carbon credit creation, transfer, and retirement simple, transparent, and fully auditable for all stakeholders. This smart contract allows organizations and individuals to take verifiable climate action by tokenizing carbon credits and retiring them to offset emissions.

## Project Vision
To empower a global, decentralized, and trustworthy green economy, where anyone can transparently track, transfer, and retire carbon credits towards real sustainability goals—ensuring every climate action is visible, audit-proof, and accessible.

## Key Features
- **Issuance of Credits**: Admin can issue new carbon credits to project participants.
- **Carbon Credit Transfer**: Users can securely send carbon credits to others, supporting peer-to-peer green actions.
- **Credit Retirement**: Anyone can retire (burn) credits, provably offsetting emissions with a transparent, on-chain audit trail.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT/oracle data for automated credit validation.
- On-chain verification of renewable energy generation.
- Support for NFT-based green badges and supply chain emission tracking.
- Decentralized governance for community-led credit issuance and review.
